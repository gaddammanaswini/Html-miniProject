  <p>
    Mining engineering is essentially as the name suggests, the engineering, that is the science technology and application of mining that is the extraction of minerals. It involves studying subjects such as electrical and mechanical engineering, engineering drawing, mining safety, mining survey, computer aided design and drafting, and etc. The course includes subjects ranging from English, mathematics, electronics, and mining, to assisting subjects like applied sciences, graphics, etcetera which would help the candidate be successful in this field. The course is best suited for those that are capable of thinking critically and are good at analysing situations and are capable of working in teams or leading them. The course will prepare its students for a career in mining engineering and related areas of engineering or research and development. Career wise it definitely leaves the doors open and allows students to move into academia or into research and development, take on technical jobs, and of course work in the field of mining engineering, either as a technical lead, or an engineer itself. Subjects taught in Diploma in Mining Engineering are Mining Geology, Introduction to Mining, Mining Practices, Surface Mining, Blasting Techniques in Mines, Mine surveying practice, mine machinery, Rock Mechanics and Ground Control, etc. After completing the Diploma in Mining Engineering students can opt for higher studies in the field.
